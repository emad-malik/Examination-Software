Descriptive
What is the difference between supervised and unsupervised learning in Machine Learning?
Supervised learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on labeled data, while unsupervised learning involves training the algorithm on unlabeled data.

Descriptive
What is the Turing Test in Artificial Intelligence?
The Turing Test is a test of a machine's ability to exhibit intelligent behavior equivalent to, or indistinguishable from, that of a human. It involves a human evaluator who interacts with a machine and a human, and tries to identify which is the machine and which is the human based on their responses.
