True/False
The purpose of research is to find answers to questions by applying a systematic process.
A: True

A: True
B: False`A

True/False

A: True
B: False`A

True/False

Descriptive
Describe the difference between a cross-sectional study and a longitudinal study in research methodology.`
Cross-sectional studies involve collecting data at a single point in time, while longitudinal studies involve collecting data over an extended period. Cross-sectional studies can provide a snapshot of a population at a particular time, but they cannot establish cause-and-effect relationships or show changes over time. Longitudinal studies, on the other hand, can provide insight into changes over time and the effects of a particular intervention, but they can be expensive and time-consuming to conduct.
