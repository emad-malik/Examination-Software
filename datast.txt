Descriptive
Explain the difference between a stack and a queue in data structures, and give an example of a scenario where each one might be used.`
In a stack, elements are added and removed from the top of the stack in a last-in-first-out (LIFO) order. This means that the most recently added element is the first one to be removed. A real-world example of a stack is a pile of books, where the book on top is the last one added and the first one to be removed. In a queue, elements are added at the back and removed from the front of the queue in a first-in-first-out (FIFO) order. This means that the first element added is the first one to be removed. A real-world example of a queue is a line of people waiting to board a bus, where the person who arrived first is the first one to board the bus.
